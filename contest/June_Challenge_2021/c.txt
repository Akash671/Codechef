Chef has two numbers N and M. Help Chef to find number of integer N-tuples (A1,A2,…,AN) such that 0≤A1,A2,…,AN≤2M−1 and A1&A2&…&AN=0, where &

denotes the bitwise AND operator.

Since the number of tuples can be large, output it modulo 109+7

.
Input

    The first line contains a single integer T

denoting the number of test cases. The description of T
test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N
and M

    .

Output

For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem modulo 109+7

.
Constraints

    1≤T≤105

1≤N,M≤106

Explanation

Test Case 1
: The only possible tuple is (0)

.

Test Case 2
: The tuples are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (1,2), (2,1).
